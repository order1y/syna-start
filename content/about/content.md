Orderly is a startup based in Kazakhstan that strives to improve how organisations store their documents. We create a document structure that enables your clients to faster find the information they are looking for.
We are experts in natural language processing and created a comprehensive search tool that doesn't look for keywords that you typed, but tries to understand what you are looking for semantically.


---

But that's not the only thing - we also created an engine that can analyse what users are clicking and whether or not they found what they needed... in order to improve the search model for the next users!

With time, our search engine becomes better and better!
