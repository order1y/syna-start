Orderly is a startup based in Kazakhstan that strives to improve how organisations store their documents. We create a document structure that enables your clients to faster find the information they are looking for.
We are experts in natural language processing and created a comprehensive search tool that doesn't just look for keywords that you typed, but tries to understand what you are looking for semantically.
Orderly provides cloud-native production ready search framework based on deep learning algorithms. Our solution is easily scalable with support for async, replicas and sharding.
We enable large scale index and semantic search for any text.

But that's not the only thing - we also created an engine that can analyse what users are clicking and whether or not they found what they needed... in order to improve the search model for the next users!

With time, our search engine becomes better and better! The more your clients search through Orderly engine - the better results they get.

Some use cases:
- search for ecommerce
- search for legal entities
- search for financial institutions
